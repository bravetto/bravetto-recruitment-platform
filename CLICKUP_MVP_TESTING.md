# üß™ ClickUp Integration MVP Testing Guide

## Quick Start Testing

### 1. Test the Integration Locally

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application**: http://localhost:3002

3. **Test the Full-Stack Developer flow**:
   - Click on "SENIOR FULL-STACK DEVELOPER" card
   - Click "Submit Dusty Resume" to test email flow
   - OR click "Start Your Quest" to test the modal flow

4. **Fill out the quest modal** with test data and submit

### 2. Verify in ClickUp

1. **Login to ClickUp**: https://app.clickup.com
2. **Navigate to your list** (ID: 901110917543)
3. **Look for the new task** named "[Test Name] - Quest Application"
4. **Verify**:
   - Task description contains all candidate information
   - Custom fields are populated
   - Tags are applied: `quest-application`, `candidate`

### 3. Quick API Test

Test the API directly using curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/submit-quest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

## üîç What to Check

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- Modal shows success message
- Response includes taskId
- Task appears in ClickUp within seconds
- All data is properly formatted

### ‚ùå Common Issues:

1. **"Server configuration error"**
   - Check your .env.local file has all variables
   - Restart your dev server after adding env vars

2. **Task not appearing in ClickUp**
   - Verify API key is correct
   - Check list ID matches your ClickUp workspace
   - Look in ClickUp's "All" view (not just active tasks)

3. **Custom fields not populated**
   - Some field IDs might not match your ClickUp setup
   - Check console logs for field mapping errors

## üöÄ MVP Success Criteria

Your MVP is working if:
1. ‚úÖ Form submissions create tasks in ClickUp
2. ‚úÖ Basic candidate info is captured (name, email)
3. ‚úÖ Users see success confirmation
4. ‚úÖ No errors block the user experience

## üìà Next Steps After MVP

Once basic integration is working:
1. Map additional custom fields
2. Add Slack notifications
3. Implement automated email responses
4. Create recruitment dashboard
5. Add interview scheduling

**Remember**: This is an MVP! Focus on getting the basic flow working first, then iterate and improve.
