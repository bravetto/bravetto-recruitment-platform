# API Fix Summary - Quest Submission Error

## Issue
The modal was showing an error: "Quest submission failed: 'Name and email are required'" because the API endpoint was still expecting the old `fullName` field, but the form had been updated to use separate `firstName` and `lastName` fields.

## Root Cause
When we updated the modal form structure in v2.9 to split the name field, we didn't update the corresponding API endpoint to match the new data structure.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Interface
```typescript
// Before
basicInfo: {
  fullName: string;
  email: string;
  location: string;
  portfolio: string;
}

// After
basicInfo: {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  location: string;
  portfolio: string;
  linkedin: string;
}
```

### 2. Updated Validation
- Changed from checking `fullName` to checking both `firstName` and `lastName`
- Updated error message to: "First name, last name, and email are required"

### 3. Updated Response
- Now returns both individual name fields and a combined `fullName`
- Includes the LinkedIn field in logging

## Result
The API now correctly handles the new form structure with:
- Separate first and last name fields
- LinkedIn URL field
- Proper validation for all required fields
- Backward compatibility by still providing a combined `fullName` in the response
