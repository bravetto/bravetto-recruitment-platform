# BravettoQuestModal Dropdown UX Improvements (v2.3)

## Issues Identified in Level 2 Dropdown

1. **Poor Visibility**: Dropdown content was cut off and not fully visible
2. **Difficult to Close**: Had to click back into the field to close dropdown
3. **No Search**: Hard to find options in long lists
4. **Limited Feedback**: Unclear how many items were selected
5. **No Keyboard Support**: Couldn't use Escape key to close

## Improvements Implemented
