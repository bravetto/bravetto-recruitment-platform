# V0 Integration Steps - Waiting for Files

## Current Status: ⏳ Awaiting V0 Files

Please complete these steps first:

1. **Drag the `v0-landing` folder** into `src/components/landing/v0/` in Cursor's file explorer
2. **Drag the `v0-modal` folder** into `src/components/shared/Modal/` in Cursor's file explorer

## Once Files Are Added, I Will:

### 1. 🔍 Analyze Both Projects
- Scan all components in both V0 projects
- Identify naming conflicts
- Check for duplicate components
- List all dependencies
- Extract CSS variables and themes

### 2. 🎨 Create Merged globals.css
- Preserve existing shadcn theme
- Extract V0 landing page styles
- Extract V0 modal styles
- Merge with conflict resolution
- Add proper CSS variable prefixes

### 3. 📁 Organize Components
```
src/components/
├── landing/
│   ├── HeroSection.tsx      (from V0)
│   ├── Features.tsx         (from V0)
│   ├── Testimonials.tsx     (from V0)
│   └── index.ts            (barrel export)
├── shared/
│   ├── Modal/
│   │   ├── Modal.tsx        (from V0)
│   │   ├── ModalHeader.tsx  (from V0)
│   │   ├── ModalBody.tsx    (from V0)
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── ui/                      (shadcn components)
```

### 4. ♻️ Refactor Duplicate Code
- Extract shared utilities
- Create common hooks
- Consolidate animation variants
- Merge duplicate types/interfaces

### 5. 🚀 Set Up Routing
- Configure Next.js App Router
- Create landing page route
- Set up modal triggers
- Add navigation between sections

## Expected File Structure from V0

### v0-landing should contain:
- Components (Hero, Features, etc.)
- Styles (CSS or styled components)
- Assets (images, fonts)
- Any configuration files

### v0-modal should contain:
- Modal components
- Modal styles
- Animation configurations
- Usage examples

## Ready to Proceed

Once you've added the V0 files, I'll immediately begin the analysis and integration process. The entire integration should take about 5-10 minutes once the files are in place.
