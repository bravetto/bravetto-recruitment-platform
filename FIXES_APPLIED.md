# Bravetto Recruitment Platform - Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document details the surgical fixes applied to make the landing page and modal fully operational.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing CSS Import** ✅
**Issue**: The `bravetto.css` file containing all landing page styles wasn't being loaded.
**Fix**: Added import statement to `src/app/globals.css`:
```css
/* Import Bravetto Landing Page Styles */
@import "../components/landing/v0/bravetto-recruitment-platform-tech-landing-page/app/bravetto.css";
```

### 2. **Missing Google Fonts** ✅
**Issue**: Orbitron and Inter fonts required by the landing page weren't loaded.
**Fix**: Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` to include:
- Font preconnect links
- Google Fonts stylesheet with Orbitron and Inter
- Updated metadata with proper title and description

### 3. **Modal Component Props** ✅
**Issue**: Modal component didn't accept the `onClose` prop being passed from the landing page.
**Fix**: 
- Added `BravettoQuestModalProps` interface
- Updated component to accept `onClose` prop
- Changed initial state from `false` to `true` (modal shows when mounted)
- Updated all `setIsOpen(false)` calls to also invoke `onClose?.()`

### 4. **API Route Creation** ✅
**Issue**: The `/api/submit-application` endpoint was missing from the main app.
**Fix**: Created `src/app/api/submit-application/route.ts` with:
- Proper NextResponse handling
- ClickUp API integration template
- Environment variable support
- Simulated response for testing

## Environment Configuration Required

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:
```env
# ClickUp API Configuration
CLICKUP_API_KEY=your_clickup_api_key_here
CLICKUP_LIST_ID=your_clickup_list_id_here
```

## Current Status

✅ **Landing Page**: Fully styled with all animations and interactions working
✅ **Modal**: Properly integrated with open/close functionality
✅ **API Endpoint**: Ready for ClickUp integration
✅ **Fonts**: All custom fonts loading correctly
✅ **Styles**: All CSS properly scoped and imported

## Testing

The application is running on http://localhost:3002 with:
- Landing page displaying correctly with all Bravetto branding
- Interactive demo with AI agents
- Modal opens/closes properly
- Form validation working
- API endpoint ready for submission handling

## Next Steps

1. Configure actual ClickUp API credentials in `.env.local`
2. Test full application submission flow
3. Deploy to production environment
